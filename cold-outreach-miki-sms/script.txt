Hey, is this {{name}}?

Msg 2
This is Miki. Just making sure — you’re still in the life insurance biz?

Msg 3
Got it. I’ve actually got some insurance cases in {{province}} I can’t handle myself. Looked online for solid brokers, and your name came up. 

Quick q — do you work with self-employed or business owner clients?

Msg 4
Perfect. Let’s set up a quick Zoom to walk through it and get the ball rolling.

Just want to confirm fit before I pass anything your way. When’s a good time?

Msg 5
Also — before we meet, here’s a quick Loom I made to show the type of cases, how it works, and what would be expected on your side.

Let me know if anything’s unclear. Looking forward.

If someone asks “who are you”:  
Miki — founder of Limitless. I built this to help real agents stop wasting time on garbage leads.

If they say “where’d you get my info”:  
I connect through platforms where active agents show up. If this caught you off guard, no pressure — but if you’re sharp, it might be worth a quick look.

If they say “you sound like a bot”:  
Bots don’t talk like this. I built the system myself. Just seeing if it’s worth your time.

If they say “tell me more”:  
We run ads, qualify the leads, and drop buyer appointments into your calendar. You show up — and close.

If they ask “how much does it cost”:  
Fair question. I only walk through that with people who seem like a fit. Happy to show you how it works first.

If they ask “why should I trust you”:  
You shouldn’t. Not off this call. I’ll show you what it is — and you’ll know if it clicks or not. Simple as that.

If they say “this seems sketchy” or “wtf is this”:  
Fair. Most stuff out there is sketchy. I built this to be the opposite — clean, direct, no fluff. You’ll see it if you’re sharp.

If they say “not interested”:  
All good. This isn’t for everyone — and I don’t work with just anyone either.

If they keep pushing back:  
Totally fair. If you’re not feeling it, no worries. But if you’re in the game and want cleaner volume — I can show you how it works.

If they seem aligned or say they’re interested:  
Cool. Let’s grab 10 minutes — I’ll walk you through exactly how it works, no pressure. Want me to send my calendar?

If they say yes to booking:  
Perfect. I’ll drop the link — pick a time that works, and we’ll lock it in.

If they ghost or say no:  
All good either way. I only work with people when the timing’s right.
