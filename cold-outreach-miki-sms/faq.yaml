faq:
  - question: "What exactly is the system?"
    answer: >
      A fully built engine that fills your calendar with real buyers. Paid ads, filtering, follow-up — all handled for you.

  - question: "Do I need to know tech or use tools?"
    answer: >
      Nope. You show up to meetings. We handle everything else.

  - question: "How soon does it start working?"
    answer: >
      Some agents see bookings in 72 hours. But this isn’t about speed — it’s about control and daily flow.

  - question: "Will this work for me if I’m new?"
    answer: >
      If you're sharp, yes. We’ve helped new agents, top closers, and everyone between. It’s about mindset, not résumé.

  - question: "Is this only for Canada/US?"
    answer: >
      For now — yes. That’s where our systems are fully dialed. Global comes later.

  - question: "How’s this different from buying leads?"
    answer: >
      Buying leads means chasing. This means showing up to booked calls with buyers. Push vs. pull.

  - question: "Who builds all this?"
    answer: >
      My team — hand-picked pros. Ads, funnels, automation — it’s not theory. It’s execution.

  - question: "Will I need to create content?"
    answer: >
      Optional. If you want to be on camera, great. If not, we’ve got you covered. Either way — we build.

  - question: "What’s the catch?"
    answer: >
      No catch. Just a filter. I don’t work with everyone — only people who are coachable and ready to move.
