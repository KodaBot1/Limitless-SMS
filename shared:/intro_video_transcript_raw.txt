(0:00) You landed here because you applied for an interview with me and this is not by accident. (0:06) In this video, I will explain to you exactly what it is that we do and how I can help you (0:11) reach success in this life insurance industry. If you qualify for my program, I will personally (0:18) build a customized digital machine flooding your calendar every single day with 5 to 10 (0:25) pre-qualified, pre-nurtured, exclusive meetings with clients ready to buy with budget and with (0:35) intention.
And so finishing this video is the first step to qualifying. So let me dive quickly (0:42) into who I am, who my team is, and what it is that we do. My name is Miki and I started in (0:48) the life insurance industry in 2020, right during COVID at 20 years old.
And like most agents, (0:55) I was told to make a top 100 list of my warm market friends and family, asking for help, (1:02) opinions, and offering free financial analysis. But the problem was at 20 years old, my warm (1:08) market was literally non-existent. It actually took me about 10 days to go through my whole (1:13) warm market because all my friends were in college, broke, and uninterested in life insurance.
(1:18) But I had a goal, right? When I started, I was coming to make 6 figures, $100,000 my very first (1:24) year. Nothing less, I was ready to do whatever it took. But the question was now, how? (1:32) Quickly I realized that the conventional or traditional way, the scripts and systems (1:37) and strategies that I was told to use to generate more business from my directors, (1:42) companies, and uplines was really just outdated.
And I knew right then and there that it was not (1:49) gonna work for me. I literally had to think outside of that box, outside of that matrix, (1:56) to figure out a way, my own way, a solution to my problem. And I knew for a fact that I could (2:04) only rely on myself, not my parents, not my friends, not my upline, not lead vendors, (2:11) or no one else, no external forces.
My power was within my own hands. I hired mentors online and (2:21) in real life, I bought all the courses I could find, I worked day and night, thousands invested (2:27) with zero excuses. I treated it like a true business, like my ticket to freedom, (2:35) not a part-time side chick sales gig.
And so I studied the game, learning from the best, (2:41) and I quickly started noticing patterns, right, from those winning and also those losing at the (2:47) game. And ultimately the question that led to all of the answers, what am I really doing here? Like (2:54) not just what am I doing, but what am I really doing? Am I paid to go to these company weekend (3:01) events? Am I paid based on the amount of technical or theory knowledge on life insurance and finance (3:09) or investments I have? Am I paid to post on social media or read books in the morning or (3:15) the amounts of hours I work like an employee or about how much my director likes me, (3:22) how much paperwork I filled? Or, or am I paid by performance, by commission based on the quantity (3:34) of clients I bring in and how much premium they buy? The goal became clear. Once I asked myself (3:45) this question, all is simple, maximal income with minimal time, effort, and energy invested, (3:56) right? Maximal output and results for minimum input.
All the rest, all the things I mentioned (4:04) earlier are either a secondary goal, right? A means to the primary goal, like reading books or (4:11) the amounts of hours you work. Sure, they might be correlated to the main goal, but they are not (4:17) the goal, right? They are noise, distraction, and literally in many cases, mental masturbation. (4:25) And so at that point, my second month in the business, I spent $8,000 I didn't have to hire (4:32) the best business consultant in my city.
And while my family's friends and colleagues around (4:38) me thought I was crazy, I knew something they didn't. I knew that excellence requires sacrifice. (4:48) And so for this $8,000, I had a six month coaching program one-on-one when we worked hands on my (4:57) business where I would meet every two weeks with him and we would work strategy, my sales scripts, (5:03) my branding, my marketing, right? The automation tools I was using, the technology, the CRM, (5:09) the delegation strategies, hiring people, hiring talent in order to do the tasks that I can (5:16) delegate in order to focus on what is truly important.
And my first month working with him, (5:22) I crossed the $10,000 a month line. Actually, my second month working with him, I doubled my revenue, (5:30) breaking the 20K line. My fifth month in the business, I was now top 30 in my country, (5:38) in my company, in personal sales production at just 20 years old.
And finally, my eighth month, (5:45) I crossed the $100,000 line. And now I'm not saying this just to brag, but if a young 20 year old (5:53) with zero sales or financial experience could do it, it's because of the system. Not luck, not magic, (6:02) the system.
Think about it. While other agents were running after broke clients that need, (6:10) you know, five meetings and endless follow-ups just to close a $30 a month policy that they (6:18) actually just end up canceling the wheat after and the agent gets a chargeback or a refund. (6:24) After having filled the endless paperwork on the other side, I was automatically, predictably (6:32) getting every single day, five to 10 meetings with pre-qualified, pre-nurtured, rich and interested (6:40) clients right in my calendar without lifting a finger.
That is the power of the system you will (6:50) have if you qualify. Eventually what started happening is that the machine started working (6:56) too well. It was actually going too fast for what I could personally handle.
I was getting (7:03) more appointments than I could personally handle. And so I just did the next logical step, right? (7:10) I started outsourcing the meetings to other agents, basically sending the meeting or the lead (7:15) in exchange for 25% commission on the close deal, you know, getting passive income while I slept (7:21) from that side and closing my own deals. What ended up happening is that some directors from (7:27) other cities in my company, but also other companies as well, started seeing what I was (7:33) doing and started asking me if I could run it for their teams, doing it for the client acquisition (7:38) and from some, even some other sides doing it for the recruit acquisition, right? Recruiting (7:44) new agents or perhaps even recruit acquisition, recruiting agents from other companies.
(7:49) Eventually even other industries saw it, you know, like realtors, mortgage brokers, gym owners, (7:56) restaurants. And so I started really just doing it, applying the system, the solution I had built for (8:02) my own problem and helping others. And that is really when I began to see the bigger picture, (8:11) the new way, the modern way, the digital era, the limitless entrepreneur.
And that's truly (8:18) something I really, really believe is that any human with the right resources, with the right (8:26) tools, with the right systems has the potential to become limitless. At that point, the machine had (8:33) taken a life of its own and we scaled globally, hiring elite copywriters, creative geniuses, (8:41) funnel hackers, media buying snipers, tech wizards, and more talent was getting in. Today, (8:47) five years later, we have worked with thousands of life insurance agents all across Canada and the (8:54) U S in many languages, people from all ages and all companies.
And we have spent over $10 million in (9:03) advertising budget combined on all social media platforms. But the true power of our service is (9:11) not just the quantity of people and dollars we have worked with. It's the quality of the (9:17) relationships we have managed to get and keep throughout those years, building literally the (9:25) best team on the market for life insurance agents and working with elite, elite life insurance (9:33) advisors, people that have huge teams of thousands of agents, as well as working with new agents, (9:40) people starting that don't know how to get the ball rolling, as well as some people that are (9:45) doing it on a part-time basis and that actually want to go full time.
Some people that have been (9:51) in the game for years, but that don't actually know how to start to adapt to the digital world. (9:58) We're working with people talking all different languages, customized campaigns for the client (10:03) or recruit acquisition, people speaking Mandarin, Portuguese, Spanish, French, English. We're doing (10:10) it based on personal branding or creating a whole new AI avatars, literally changing the game every (10:17) day that we play it.
Now, at this point, you may be wondering, okay, but what's the actual system? (10:23) Well, that's actually the goal, right? The goal of the meeting is to show you exactly what it is (10:28) we do, but at least for this video, I'll at least show you the fundamentals, right? The basics, the (10:34) meat and potatoes of this system that I have built over the years is basically paid advertising on (10:42) social media platforms and the essence of it can be fundamentally simplified to one thing, leverage. (10:50) Through the proper leverage of the right tools, agents become limitless and the system's framework (10:58) can be understood best through a triangle or a trinity. First is what I call the copy, that would (11:06) be the words, right? The scripts that you see, the stuff that people hear and read.
Trigger words and (11:12) psycho-subconscious programming that makes people move and make decisions, right? Every line (11:21) calibrated to make people take action in the logical and the emotional. The second step is (11:30) the creatives, I call it, right? Which is more like the left brain, the visuals, the more artistic (11:36) side, right? And here, especially in this tick tock day and age of Facebook and YouTube and (11:42) social media in general, attention is currency and that people think in images before they think (11:50) in words, before they read, they feel. So the creatives are the actual visuals, right? The (11:57) images and videos, the colors, the branding that magnetize the eyes, shift states and pull people (12:05) in on the actual ad that we create for you.
At this point, you have the two first lines of the (12:12) triangle, you've got the copy and the creative. And let me make this clear, this is 100% done (12:18) for you, right? You don't need any prior skills. My team will do it all fully for you if you (12:26) qualify on our interview.
Now, number three is the targeting. Coming back to the Trinity, (12:32) the third part is the actual digital aspect to this whole thing. Because so far with the copy and (12:38) the creative, that is the basics of the advertising world, right? When you see it on the bus or on (12:44) TV or all of that.
But here is the social media targeting. And that is truly where the whole (12:50) system takes life. Because really, when it comes to social media paid advertising, no matter how (12:57) good your copy or your creatives are, if the right people don't see them, it's useless.
And (13:05) that is why I see so many agents said, yeah, I tried, you know, on social media platforms and (13:10) blah, blah, blah. But what they've truly been doing is just posting random posts that no one (13:16) reads, blogs that your company has given you or given you the right to post on your profile on (13:23) Facebook that only your aunt will, you know, like and comment. The real way to use social media in (13:30) 2025 with a paid ad system lies in hyper focused targeting.
What we do is we use algorithms and (13:40) social media functions in order to show the ads we crafted to the right people at the right time, (13:47) systematically and automatically making them book meetings in your calendar, (13:55) my teams build the full digital real estate, the website, the landing pages and funnels, (14:00) the workflows and automation implementing AI in a personalized way, plugging it all into an ad (14:07) platform and letting the machine that we build for you hunt for you. No guessing. We systematically (14:15) dominate.
And while your competition is posting articles on LinkedIn that no one reads and is, (14:23) you know, spamming people on LinkedIn and Facebook, you're actually winning. And the best part is that (14:30) you're able to leverage my experience, all of the other agents experience that have worked with me (14:36) and my team's experience in order to make this machine be plugged into your business without (14:44) needing tech skills or any skills whatsoever, other than the only one that truly matters, (14:51) closing deals, meeting clients. And imagine your new reality.
If you do end up qualifying for the (14:59) program, you will have a system, a system booking every single day meetings with your ideal (15:06) clients, right? Pre-nurtured pre-qualified booked right in your calendar. There are actual criteria (15:13) to respect standards to meet. This is not a sales call.
It will be an interview for the boat of us. (15:23) You see, in the past four years, I worked with thousands of agents and I have seen the patterns (15:30) emerge. And there is two kinds of advisors.
The first kind is indecisive. In some cases, incapable (15:39) of taking action, incompetent, fearful in the name of patients and out of weakness of their own gut (15:49) and will. They essentially give out their power to external forces.
They become faithless to their (15:56) vision and become slaves to the visions of others. I really don't say this in a mean but realistic (16:04) way. And although, yeah, I am pointing fingers here, I am not condemning them.
Foolishness isn't (16:12) mortal sin, right? Then there's the second type of agents, the ones that know what winning truly (16:19) requires. The ones with an unshakable, grounded and powerful will. Be it talent, mindset, you know, (16:28) maybe it's nature or nurture, whatever it is.
Maybe they're just simply favored by God. I don't know (16:34) that. What I do know is that patterns always emerge if you observe.
And those types of agents, that's (16:41) who I want to work with, right? The focused people, the people that are able to think freely and (16:48) independently. The ones that are able, that have the power to obsess over details and study and go (16:55) all in. The ones that are disciplined and courageous in the face of fear.
The creative, the resourceful, (17:03) the ones that have faith in themselves. They simply think and move differently, flying over the barriers (17:10) while others are stuck tripping in the carpet's flowers. And most importantly, and perhaps the (17:17) origin of everything I just mentioned, they are committed to winning.
They carve their own path. (17:26) They bet on themselves, right? And they take what is theirs without asking for permission. True power (17:35) requires strategy, creativity, strength and independence from the herd's dogma.
In this (17:45) business, I only make money if you do. And that means that you need to be capable of driving the (17:52) machine that I will build for you, right? And that is the goal of the call, is to see if you have the (17:58) competence to see what type of person you are. Truly, I just want to know if you've got what it (18:04) takes.
I have zero interest in working with indecisive or unprofessional people. But if you're (18:12) serious, if you're ready to commit, this system will change your business and your life. And you (18:21) will leave our call with clarity and power, whether we decide to work together or not.
Come sharp, (18:29) on time, pen and paper, on your computer, no distractions, full focus, coffee and questions ready. (18:36) Stay Limitless.
