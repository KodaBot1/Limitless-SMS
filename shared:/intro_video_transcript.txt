You landed here because you applied for an interview with me — and this is not by accident.

In this video, I’m going to explain exactly what it is that we do and how I can help you reach success in the life insurance industry. If you qualify for my program, I’ll personally build a customized digital machine that floods your calendar every single day with 5 to 10 pre-qualified, pre-nurtured, exclusive meetings — clients ready to buy, with budget and intention.

Finishing this video is the first step to qualifying.

My name is Miki, and I got started in life insurance during COVID in 2020, at just 20 years old. Like most agents, I was told to make a list of my warm market — friends, family, neighbors — and start pitching. But the problem was, at 20, I didn’t have a warm market. My friends were broke college students.

Ten days in, I had already exhausted my entire list. But I had a goal — I came in aiming to make six figures, and I wasn’t leaving without doing it. So I realized I had to think outside the box.

The traditional scripts, strategies, and outdated advice from my company and uplines just weren’t going to cut it. I knew I had to take ownership and build something real. I hired mentors, bought courses, studied the game day and night. I treated it like a business — not a side hustle.

Month 1: I hit $10K. Month 2: $20K. By Month 5, I was top 30 in the company. By Month 8, I crossed $100K in commissions — with zero sales background. Not luck. The system.

While most agents were chasing broke clients for $30 policies, I was getting 5 to 10 daily meetings — pre-qualified, high-intent buyers — without lifting a finger.

Eventually the system worked so well, I had more leads than I could handle. So I outsourced to other agents, earning passive income while helping them close. That led to directors, leaders, even other industries asking if I could build systems for them too.

Now we’ve helped thousands of agents across the U.S. and Canada. We’ve spent over $10M on ads. But more than that, we’ve built real, long-lasting relationships and delivered results.

The system? It’s based on paid advertising, but with extreme precision.

It’s built on a triangle: copy, creative, and targeting.

Copy = words engineered to move people emotionally and logically

Creative = visuals and branding that magnetize attention

Targeting = showing the right message to the right person at the right time

And it’s all 100% done for you — if you qualify. No tech skills. No prior marketing experience.

My team builds everything: your site, funnel, automation, ads — and we plug it into a machine that books meetings for you daily. While your competitors are cold calling and begging, you’re taking calls with serious buyers.

But not everyone qualifies.

This isn’t a sales pitch — it’s a filter.

I only make money if you do. I work with agents who are decisive, focused, and coachable.

So, if that’s you — come sharp. Watch this video, take notes, show up to the call with questions.

And let’s map out your next move.

Stay Limitless.
